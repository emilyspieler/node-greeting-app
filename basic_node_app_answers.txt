What is a Node module?
A node module is a set of functions you want to include in your application

What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
The main difference is that module.exports can be reassigned to anything. Any reassignment of exports will not be available outside of the module

Why is using exports recommended?

By setting as exports you are using shorthand and avoid potential bugs later on down the road.
Using exports.prop = true instead of module.exports.prop = true saves characters and avoids confusion on non-specific object type data.
